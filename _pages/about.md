Hello World! I am Animesh Sengupta, a [parseltongue](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Parseltongue) adept at all things python. I currently am a Graduate Student at [University of Massachusetts, Amherst](https://www.umass.edu) pursuing [Data Analytics and Computational Social Sciences](https://www.umass.edu/social-sciences/academics/ms-dacss).  My interests lies in the intersection of Machine learning, Engineering and Social sciences. Currently my research intersests are using 1. transformers models for cancer drug response using gene expressions 2. Evaluating and detecting hallucination in Large language models and 3. Fine Tuning and domain adapting large language models.

Recently, I was a Machine learning Implementation and Operations Summer Intern at ReSurfX, a biotech outcomes intelligence company. I also have 3 years of work experience in various software development roles at Societe Generale. Where I dabbled in various cloud application development and also migration automation. This makes me a polyglot engineer who is jack of all trades in machine learning, software development and data engineering. 

If you are still reading, here is a little bit about me, beyond my professional and academic life. You will mostly find me supporting my soccer club Chelsea in my past time. I find ways and excuses to be outdoor wether it is kayaking or hiking.
