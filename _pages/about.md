Hello World! I am Animesh Sengupta, a [parseltongue](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Parseltongue) adept at all things python. I currently am a Graduate Student at [University of Massachusetts, Amherst](https://www.umass.edu). I am pursuing [Data Analytics and Computational Social Sciences](https://www.umass.edu/social-sciences/academics/ms-dacss) as my graduate major to bring a positive change with my data wizardry. My interests lies in the intersection of Machine learning, Engineering and Social sciences. This brings me to solve interesting problems in the field of `NLP` , `Machine learning Operations` and `Socio-Bio-Informatics`.  

Recently, I worked at ReSurfX, a Biotech Company, as a Machine Learning summer intern. Prior to this I had `3 years` of work experience in Software developement and DevOps at Societe Generale GSC.
