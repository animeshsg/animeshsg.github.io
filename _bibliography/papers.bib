  abstract = {In recent years, the number of image fusion schemes presented by the research community has increased significantly. Measuring the performance of these schemes is an important issue. In this work, we introduce three quantitative fusion metrics to assess the quality of an image fusion algorithm. The proposed metrics rely on edge information that is obtained using fractional order differentiation. Edge and orientation strengths are fed into three sigmoidal functions separately for estimating the values of three normalized weighted metrics for the fused image corresponding to source images. The experiments on the multi-focus, infrared-visible and medical image fusion pairs demonstrate that the proposed fusion metrics are perceptually meaningful and outperform some of the state-of-the-art metrics.}

  title = {{IoT}-based Healthcare Monitoring System for War Soldiers using Machine Learning},
  journal = {Procedia Computer Science},
  bibtex_show={true},
  abstract  = {In today's world, warfare is an important factor in any nation's
               security. One of the important and vital roles is played by the
               army soldiers. There are many concerns regarding the safety of
               soldiers. So for their security purpose, many instruments are
               mounted on them to view their health status as well as their
               real time location. Bio-sensor systems comprise various types of
               small physiological sensors, transmission modules and processing
               capabilities, and can thus facilitate low-cost wearable
               unobtrusive solutions for health monitoring. This paper gives an
               ability to track the location and monitor health of the soldiers
               in real time who become lost and get injured in the battlefield.
               It helps to minimize the time, search and rescue operation
               efforts of army control unit. This system enables to army
               control unit to track the location and monitor health of
               soldiers using GPS module and wireless body area sensor networks
               (WBASNs), such as temperature sensor, heart beat sensor, etc.
               The data coming from sensors and GPS receiver will be
               transmitted wirelessly using ZigBee module among the fellow
               soldiers. Furthermore, LoRaWAN network infrastructure has been
               proposed to be used between the squadron leader and the control
               unit in high altitude warzones where cellular network coverage
               is either absent or does not allow data transmission. The
               collected data will be uploaded on the cloud for further data
               analysis and predictions using K-Means Clustering algorithm.}

  abstract = {A swift and efficient facial identification system is a well-known discipline of computer vision applications and thus forms a pivotal part of image processing. Despite the advantages of existing methods, there is still a great demand for modifications in these algorithms in order to close to lacks of proposed methods. In this proposed work, the image is preprocessed with Contrast-limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization and faces are detected with Haar-Cascading (Viola-Jones algorithm). Then face identification is done using BRISK (Binary Robust Invariant Scalable Key-points) descriptor. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methodology achieves better facial identification even under various challenging conditions compared with the existing BRISK.}
